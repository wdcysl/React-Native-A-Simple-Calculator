# React Native pros and cons:
This is the main privilege of all cross-platform frameworks including React Native. Instead of building two separate apps, developers can reuse most of the JS code for both Android and iOS. Then, This attribute provides almost limitless capabilities for the framework improvement with additional features.
With React Native, both the development time and time to market are significantly lessened. Instead of coding separately for Android and iOS, you save time due to the code’s reusability. Although you can’t share all of the code, your time efficiency will be extremely high. We’ll dive into that later on.

For the cons,the native-specified modules like camera access, push notifications, memory storage, device sensors, and others are the key to the above-described problem. At the same time, to take advantage of these parts of the code implemented in the native language, engineers have to possess expertise in this language. If you need to make something that is not available at React Native, you’ll have to learn Java/Kotlin or Objective-C/Swift to build the module.
In additional, each platform has a specific design language and navigation patterns – iOS has been stricter for a very long time, and Android is catching up with material design. React Native provides the automatic transformation of the graphical elements according to the required platform. However, there might be some placement issues. As a result, you have to dive deep into the code and figure out how to adjust to the design guidelines.
